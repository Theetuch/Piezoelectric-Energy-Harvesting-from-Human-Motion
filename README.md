Hey there, folks! 👋 So, you've stumbled upon my senior project report! Whether you've given it a read or not, welcome aboard! 😄 Here are the MATLAB codes I used for my project on snatching energy from human movement. Each folder has raw data from my experiments, so feel free to dig in!

Now, I gotta warn ya, my code might look like a plate of spaghetti 🍝, but hey, that's half the fun of coding, am I right? If you're scratching your head, don't sweat it! Think of it as a brain teaser just waiting to be cracked.

And hey, if you end up figuring it out better than me, power to ya! Literally! ⚡️😉

To all the future project peeps: Here's hoping your journey brings you results even more awesome than mine, and hey, don't forget to have a blast along the way! 🚀
